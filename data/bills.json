      "title": "An act to amend Section 65589.5 of the Government Code, relating to housing.",
      "summary": "AB 1633 amends the Housing Accountability Act to expand the definition of 'disapproving' a housing development project to include instances where a local agency fails to make a timely determination on a project's CEQA exemption or commits an abuse of discretion, as defined, in certain circumstances. It also expands the definition to include failing to adopt or certify a negative declaration, addendum, EIR, or comparable environmental document for a project that meets specified location and density criteria. The bill aims to facilitate housing development by limiting the ability of local agencies to disapprove or condition housing projects in violation of the Housing Accountability Act."
