      "summary": "Amends the Housing Accountability Act to expand the definition of 'disapproving' a housing development project to include instances where a local agency fails to make a timely determination on a project's CEQA exemption or commits an abuse of discretion. It also expands the definition to include failing to adopt or certify a negative declaration, addendum, EIR, or comparable environmental document for a project that meets specified location and density criteria. The bill aims to facilitate housing development by limiting the ability of local agencies to disapprove or condition housing projects in violation of the Housing Accountability Act.",

The university cannot exempt a new project until obtaining LEED Platinum for all buildings in the prior exempted project. Aims to facilitate more university housing development by easing the LEED certification requirements for CEQA exemption.",
