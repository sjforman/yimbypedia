memTitle: Junior ADUs should get the same CEQA exemption as ADUs
formalTitle: >-
  An act to amend Section 21080.17 of the Public Resources Code, relating to
  environmental quality.
summary: >-
  AB 3057 rectifies a legislative oversight by extending the existing California
  Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) exemption, which currently applies to
  standard Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) ordinances, to include Junior Accessory
  Dwelling Units (JADUs). This amendment facilitates local compliance with state
  housing laws by exempting JADU ordinances from CEQA review, mirroring the
  treatment for standard ADUs. The change aims to streamline the process for
  creating small, affordable rental units within the existing footprint of
  homes, supporting California's broader efforts to increase housing stock and
  affordability.
