memTitle: Reward transit-oriented housing; penalize non-compliance
formalTitle: An act concerning incentives for housing development near transit
summary: >-
  Establishes transit-oriented communities in Colorado to increase housing near
  transit hubs. These communities must meet housing opportunity goals by
  ensuring adequate zoned density and administrative approvals for multifamily
  developments. The bill mandates state guidance for setting these goals and
  requires regular progress reports from communities. Non-compliance may result
  in withholding of funds from the Highway User Tax Fund. The bill also
  introduces tax incentives for developments in these areas and sets up a grant
  program for infrastructure upgrades within designated transit and neighborhood
  centers.
