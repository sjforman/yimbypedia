memTitle: Allow up to 2 homes in formerly single-family zones
formalTitle: >-
  An act allowing municipalities to permit 2 residential units in certain
  single-family residential zones.
summary: >-
  Allows single-family homes on lots of 2 acres or less in at least 50% of a
  municipality's single-family zones to expand to 2 units by right, without
  discretionary review, if certain conditions are met. These include being
  outside hazard areas, not demolishing more than 25% of walls (with
  exceptions), and not eliminating moderate/low-income restricted units.
  Municipalities can apply objective standards that don't preclude 2 1,250+ sqft
  units, require septic upgrades and parking, deny projects with specific
  adverse impacts, and require 30+ day rental terms. Temporary delays allowed
  for inadequate water/sewer.
