memTitle: Mandatory upfront clarity on housing development fees
formalTitle: >-
  An act to amend Sections 65940.1 and 65941.1 of and to add Section 65943.1 to
  the Government Code relating to housing.
summary: >-
  Requires cities to provide an estimate of development fees at the time of
  building permit application, promoting fee transparency and predictability for
  housing projects. AB 1820 ensures that builders have a clear understanding of
  the financial requirements from the outset, aiming to reduce unexpected costs
  that can delay or jeopardize housing developments. The legislation mandates
  that an itemized list and total sum of all fees and exactions be provided
  within 10 days of a preliminary application, and again upon final approval of
  a housing development project. It addresses the issue of high and
  unpredictable impact fees by ensuring that developers are informed of their
  fee obligations early in the project planning process.
