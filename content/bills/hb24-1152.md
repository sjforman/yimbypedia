memTitle: Let some ADUs get built
formalTitle: An act concerning increasing the number of accessory dwelling units.
summary: >-
  The bill requires subject jurisdictions (municipalities with 1,000+ population
  and counties with census-designated places of 10,000+ within metropolitan
  planning organizations) to allow one ADU per single-family lot through an
  administrative approval process, prohibiting certain restrictions. It creates
  an incentive program certifying ADU-supportive jurisdictions, which can
  receive grants for promoting ADU construction. The bill also establishes an
  ADU loan program and prevents HOAs and planned unit developments from
  restricting ADUs more than local law.
