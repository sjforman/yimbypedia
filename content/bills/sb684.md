memTitle: For fuck's sake, at least allow *small* housing developments in urban areas.
formalTitle: >-
  An act to add Sections 65852.28, 65913.4.5, and 66499.41 to the Government
  Code, relating to land use.
summary: >-
  Requires local agencies to ministerially approve, without discretionary
  review, parcel maps, tentative maps, and final maps for housing development
  projects of 10 or fewer units on lots zoned for multifamily, 5 acres or less,
  substantially surrounded by urban uses. It streamlines building permits for
  such projects and limits the standards local agencies can impose. The bill
  exempts such projects from minimum parcel size requirements and HOA formation.
  It also prevents accessory dwelling units and SB 9 lot splits from being
  required on parcels created through this process.
