memTitle: Ease discretionary development processes
formalTitle: An act relating to towns and cities -- Zoning Ordinances
summary: >-
  Simplifies the process for obtaining development permissions, especially for
  properties that don't meet current zoning standards. Distinguishes between
  minor and significant variances, streamlining approvals for minor changes
  without board intervention unless contested by neighbors. Mandates that
  municipalities define clear, objective criteria for special use permits,
  ensuring uses not explicitly covered are permitted by default.
