memTitle: Universities building housing can have a smidge more leeway on LEED standards
formalTitle: >-
  An act to amend Section 21080.58 of the Public Resources Code, relating to
  environmental quality.
summary: >-
  Amends the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) exemption for
  university housing development projects. Changes the requirement for each
  building in an exempt project to qualify for LEED Platinum certification to
  LEED Gold certification with a point total of 79 or better. A public
  university must obtain LEED Platinum certification for each building within 12
  months of occupancy. The university cannot exempt a new project until
  obtaining LEED Platinum for all buildings in the prior exempted project. Aims
  to facilitate more university housing development by easing the LEED
  certification requirements for CEQA exemption.
