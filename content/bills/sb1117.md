  Enacts comprehensive zoning reforms to increase housing supply and
  affordability by reducing parking requirements, streamlining ADU regulations,
  and expediting residential rezoning processes. Mandates annual housing needs
  assessments to align municipal actions with growth projections. Restricts
  municipalities from imposing non-objective licensing requirements and
  simplifies the citizen review process for zoning changes. Establishes more
  flexible design standards for residential housing, prohibiting excessive
  control over aesthetic elements unless tied to historical significance or
  specific building codes.
