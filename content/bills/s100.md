formalTitle: Act Relating to Housing Opportunities Made for Everyone (HOME)
summary: >-
  Makes adjustments to municipal planning and zoning to favor higher density and
  diverse housing types like duplexes and multi-unit dwellings, particularly in
  areas served by municipal sewer and water services. Restricts excessive
  parking requirements, mandates acceptance of duplexes in single-family zones,
  eases the creation of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), and adjusts Act 250's
  jurisdictional threshold to facilitate more housing developments. Addresses
  deed restrictions, enhances compliance with energy standards, and establishes
  various committees and task forces to support ongoing housing development and
  improvement efforts.
