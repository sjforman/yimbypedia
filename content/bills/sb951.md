formalTitle: >-
  An act to amend Section 65583 of the Government Code, and to amend Section
  30603 of, and to add Section 30175 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to
  coastal resources.
summary: >-
  This bill proposes amendments to streamline housing development in coastal
  areas, particularly focusing on the California Coastal Act of 1976. It
  introduces changes aimed at easing housing element requirements and rezoning
  standards for jurisdictions within the coastal zone, including the City and
  County of San Francisco. The bill also modifies appeal processes for coastal
  development permits and allows for electronic notification to the California
  Coastal Commission. The intent is to facilitate the development of more
  housing by reducing regulatory barriers and simplifying procedures for coastal
  zone developments.
