  An Act to Clarify Statewide Laws Regarding Affordable Housing and Accessory
  Dwelling Units
summary: >-
  Amends Maine's housing laws to extend the implementation dates for affordable
  housing development requirements and accessory dwelling unit (ADU) permissions
  across municipalities. It defines 'affordable housing development' with
  specific income thresholds for rental and owned housing affordability. The act
  sets new implementation dates: January 1, 2024, for municipalities with
  ordinance enactment by municipal officers, and July 1, 2024, for others. It
  mandates municipalities to permit up to two additional dwelling units on lots
  with existing homes, subject to certain conditions, and ensures long-term
  affordability of such housing developments through restrictive covenants for a
  minimum of 30 years. The legislation also specifies zoning and subdivision
  requirements for ADUs, aiming to facilitate the addition of such units
  statewide while adhering to local and environmental regulations.
