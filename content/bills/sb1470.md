memTitle: Start fixing our draconian construction defect legal regime
formalTitle: >-
  An act to amend Sections 895, 896, 897, 916, 921, 926, 927, 933, 934, and
  945.5 of the Civil Code, relating to construction defects.
summary: >-
  Amends existing laws to modify the standards for determining liability in
  construction defect cases for residential units. It clarifies that a
  deficiency must materially affect habitability or usefulness, and result from
  failing to meet the industry's standard of care. The bill introduces a role
  for a special inspector in overseeing repair works and requires the builder to
  secure a building permit for such repairs. It also allows builders to obtain a
  release or waiver upon repair completion and mandates local authorities to
  issue building permits within 30 days. Moreover, it adds to the affirmative
  defenses available to builders in construction defect cases, including
  compliance with building permits and special inspector approval.
