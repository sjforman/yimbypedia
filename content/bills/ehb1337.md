summary: >-
  Facilitates the construction and use of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) within
  urban growth areas. Mandates cities and counties to adopt or amend regulations
  to support ADU creation, limiting the imposition of certain restrictions, such
  as off-street parking requirements within half a mile of major transit stops
  and imposing maximum gross floor area restrictions of no less than 1,000
  square feet for ADUs. Impact fees on ADUs cannot exceed 50% of those for the
  principal unit, and cities and counties cannot require ADU owners to occupy
  any unit on the property. This act also prohibits the sale or conveyance
  restrictions of ADUs as condominium units and exempts ADU-related actions from
  administrative or judicial appeals.
