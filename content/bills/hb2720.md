  AN ACT AMENDING TITLE 9 CHAPTER 4 ARTICLE 6 ARIZONA REVISED STATUTES BY ADDING
  SECTION 9-461.18; RELATING TO MUNICIPAL PLANNING
summary: >-
  HB2720 mandates Arizona municipalities with populations over 75,000 to adopt
  regulations permitting accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on single-family zoned
  lots. The bill sets allowances and prohibitions for ADUs, such as a minimum of
  one ADU per lot, additional ADUs if they are restricted-affordable, and a
  maximum size limit. It prohibits restrictions like additional parking
  requirements, design conformity mandates, and more restrictive zoning. Failure
  to adopt regulations by January 1, 2025, allows unlimited ADUs.
