memTitle: More Accountability for the Housing Accountability Act
formalTitle: An act to amend Section 65589.5 of the Government Code, relating to land use.
summary: >-
  Amends the Housing Accountability Act to further restrict a local agency's
  ability to deny or condition housing development projects. It revises the
  definition of housing for lower/moderate-income households to include projects
  dedicating at least 10% of units to lower-income households or projects of 10
  units or fewer. For agencies without a substantially compliant housing
  element, it allows project denial only if it exceeds certain density
  thresholds, fails to meet certain location/site criteria, or fails to comply
  with objective development standards from the closest multifamily residential
  zone. It deems projects meeting specified density criteria compliant with
  ministerial streamlining laws.
