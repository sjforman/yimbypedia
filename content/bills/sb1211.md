memTitle: >-
  No parking space replacement mandates, and more multi-family flexibility, for
  ADU development
formalTitle: An act to amend Section 65852.2 of the Government Code relating to land use.
summary: >-
  Amend the Planning and Zoning Law concerning the development of Accessory
  Dwelling Units (ADUs), prohibit local agencies from requiring the replacement
  of parking spaces when a carport, covered parking structure, or uncovered
  parking space is demolished or converted into an ADU. The bill modifies
  existing provisions to allow for the ministerial approval of multiple ADUs on
  lots with existing or proposed multifamily dwellings. It specifies that
  detached or attached ADUs may be developed in amounts equal to one or 25% of
  the existing multifamily dwelling units, whichever is greater, and authorizes
  two detached ADUs on lots with existing or proposed multifamily dwellings,
  subject to height limitations and setback requirements. Additionally, the bill
  ensures that the construction or conversion of ADUs does not necessitate the
  replacement of demolished or converted parking spaces. By imposing new duties
  on local governments regarding ADU approvals, SB 1211 creates a state-mandated
  local program.
