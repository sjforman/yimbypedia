summary: >-
  Revises municipal zoning laws in Montana to support the development of
  accessory dwelling units (ADUs) by requiring municipalities to permit at least
  one ADU per lot with a single-family dwelling. It limits ADU size to 75% of
  the primary residence's gross floor area or 1,000 square feet, whichever is
  less, and prohibits municipalities from imposing additional parking
  requirements, matching exterior designs, ownership occupancy requirements,
  impact fees, and more restrictive development standards than those for the
  primary dwelling. Municipalities may charge up to $250 for ADU application
  reviews but cannot enforce non-compliant regulations after January 1, 2024.
