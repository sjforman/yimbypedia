memTitle: Set housing goals, impose some density requirements, and legalize ADUs
formalTitle: >-
  An Act To Implement the Recommendations of the Commission To Increase Housing
  Opportunities in Maine by Studying Zoning and Land Use Restrictions
summary: >-
  Enacts measures to increase housing opportunities across Maine by setting
  statewide and regional housing production goals, in collaboration with the
  Maine State Housing Authority. It mandates municipalities to permit higher
  density affordable housing developments, establishing a density minimum of 2.5
  times the base density in multifamily dwelling zones, with specific off-street
  parking space caps. The act requires a 30-year minimum duration for affordable
  housing developments' restrictive covenants. Dictates municipalities to allow
  up to four dwelling units per lot in designated growth areas or where
  municipal services are available, aiming to streamline the approval process
  for such developments. Allows accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on single-family
  lots, sets minimum size requirements for ADUs, and mandates municipal
  compliance with water and wastewater service verification for housing units.
