memTitle: 'Cities: nix the arbitrary occupancy limits, let roommates be roommates.'
formalTitle: An act concerning residential occupancy limits.
summary: >-
  The bill, titled the 'HOME (Harmonizing Occupancy Measures Equitably) Act,'
  prohibits local governments from enacting or enforcing residential occupancy
  limits based on familial relationships. Local governments retain the authority
  to implement occupancy limits based only on demonstrated health and safety
  standards, such as building codes, fire codes, or wastewater and water quality
  standards, or on affordable housing program guidelines. The bill aims to
  increase housing availability by limiting the ability of local governments to
  impose arbitrary occupancy restrictions.
