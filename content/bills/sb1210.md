formalTitle: >-
  An act to add Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 8395) to Division 4.1 of the
  Public Utilities Code, relating to utility service.
summary: >-
  Prohibits connection, capacity, or other point of connection charges from
  public utilities or special districts for electrical, gas, sewer, or water
  service for new housing construction from exceeding 1% of the reported
  building permit value of the housing unit. Requires these charges to be issued
  over a period of at least 10 years from when the housing unit is first
  occupied, with subsequent owners continuing payment if sold within that
  period. Mandates public utilities and special districts to prioritize new
  housing construction for electrical, gas, sewer, and water service connections
  over other structures. Additionally, requires public reporting on the internet
  of any charges issued by the housing unitâ€™s address annually.
