memTitle: Slash NIMBY constraints statewide & allow many more homes to be built
formalTitle: 'Planning and zoning: housing development: streamlined approval: incentives.'
summary: >-
  Aimed to boost housing production by requiring local governments to grant
  incentives for housing developments that meet certain criteria, such as being
  located near jobs or transit. The bill would have amended the Housing
  Accountability Act to limit local control over housing development and
  streamline approval processes. It included provisions for sensitive
  communities and would have delayed implementation in potentially sensitive
  areas.
