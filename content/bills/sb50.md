memTitle: Legalize many more homes near jobs and transit with default zoning
formalTitle: 'PLANNING AND ZONING: HOUSING DEVELOPMENT: STREAMLINED APPROVAL: INCENTIVES'
summary: >-
  Authorizes streamlined, ministerial approval for neighborhood multifamily
  projects on eligible parcels without conditional use permits. Defines eligible
  projects and parcels, limits local parking requirements, and sets automatic
  expiration of approval in 3 years with possible one-year extension. Exempts
  projects from CEQA. Requires cities, counties, or both to grant an equitable
  communities incentive for developments meeting specific criteria, including
  being a job-rich or transit-rich housing project, with additional requirements
  for developments in counties based on population size. Implements delays for
  sensitive communities, with certain exemptions for local flexibility plans
  approved by the Department of Housing and Community Development.
