formalTitle: >-
  An act to amend Section 65589.5 of, to amend, repeal, and add Sections 65940,
  65943, and 65950 of, to add and repeal Sections 65905.5, 65913.10, and 65941.1
  of, and to add and repeal Chapter 12 (commencing with Section 66300) of
  Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code, relating to housing.
summary: >-
  Aims to accelerate housing production across the state by imposing
  restrictions on local jurisdictions' ability to downzone or cap the number of
  housing permits. The Act prohibits local agencies from disapproving housing
  development projects that comply with current zoning rules unless specific
  findings are provided. It further aims to streamline the housing approval
  process by limiting the number of public hearings on projects and by
  suspending local practices that directly or indirectly inhibit the feasibility
  of housing projects compliant with existing zoning and planning standards.
  This Act is part of broader efforts to address California's housing shortage
  and affordability crisis by facilitating the development of more housing
  units, including low-, moderate-, and high-income housing.
