memTitle: Cities, fuck off with your spurious pocket housing vetoes and CEQA abuse.
formalTitle: An act to amend Section 65589.5 of the Government Code, relating to housing.
summary: >-
  Amends the Housing Accountability Act to expand the definition of
  'disapproving' a housing development project to include instances where a
  local agency fails to make a timely determination on a project's CEQA
  exemption or commits an abuse of discretion. It also expands the definition to
  include failing to adopt or certify a negative declaration, addendum, EIR, or
  comparable environmental document for a project that meets specified location
  and density criteria. The bill aims to facilitate housing development by
  limiting the ability of local agencies to disapprove or condition housing
  projects in violation of the Housing Accountability Act.
