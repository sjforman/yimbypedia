memTitle: Do a bunch of YIMBY zoning reforms all at once
formalTitle: AN ACT relating to housing opportunities.
summary: >-
  The HOME (Housing Opportunities Made Easier) Act aims to expand housing
  options in Kentucky. It prohibits minimum square footage requirements and most
  aesthetic design standards on housing unless necessary for health and safety.
  It allows duplexes in all single-family zones, triplexes and quadplexes in
  city single-family zones, and secondary dwelling units and tiny homes on
  single-family lots. It streamlines permitting and variance processes and
  limits fees. It allows home occupations and mixed-use in residential and
  commercial zones, with some restrictions. The bill also prevents most rental
  restrictions by local governments.
