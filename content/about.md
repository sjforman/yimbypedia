YIMBYpedia was built by me, [Scott J. Forman](https://sjforman.me/). I was an early employee at [Opower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opower), and I founded and serve on the board of directors of [Vote Forward](https://votefwd.org/). 

I've become, lately, every-increasingly YIMBY-pilled and convinced that self-imposed housing scarcity is at the root of a great many of our problems as a society. I found myself struggling to keep track of the many legislative efforts in this domain, so I decided to build this.  

It's a compendium of YIMBY legislative efforts. My goal is to provide a centralized resource for individuals and organizations seeking to understand and analyze this legislative landscape.
