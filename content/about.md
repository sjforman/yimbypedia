YIMBYpedia was built by me, [Scott J. Forman](https://sjforman.me/). I was an early employee at [Opower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opower), and I founded and serve on the board of directors of [Vote Forward](https://votefwd.org/). 

Lately, I've become every-increasingly YIMBY-pilled and convinced that self-imposed housing scarcity is at the root of a great many of our problems as a society. As I read about the many legislative efforts underway to address this issue, I found myself struggling to keep track of them. 

I figured there must exist a database of them all, somewhere. But evidently not. So I built this compendium for my own reference. Hopefully others seeking to understand and analyze this landscape will find it useful too.

I've seeded the site with a few dozen individual bills, with an emphasis on ADU legislation. 

But there are hundreds more, and I can't keep track of them all. So contributions are welcome here: [](). Thanks in advance!
