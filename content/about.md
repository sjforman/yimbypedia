YIMBYpedia was built by me, [Scott J. Forman](https://sjforman.me/). I was an early employee at [Opower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opower), and I founded and serve on the board of directors of [Vote Forward](https://votefwd.org/). 

Lately I've become every-increasingly YIMBY-pilled, convinced that self-imposed housing scarcity is at the root of a great many of our problems as a society. 

Reading about the work legislators are doing to address this issue, I found myself struggling to keep track of all the attempts. I figured someone must have made a database of them all. 

But evidently not! So I built this for my own reference. Hopefully others seeking to understand and analyze this landscape will find it useful.
